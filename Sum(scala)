  // EXERCISE 6: write a function "sum" that takes a list of integers and
  // sums them.
  //
  // As with all of the exercises in this assignment, your function MUST be
  // recursive and MUST NOT use a while loop.
  def sum(xs: List[Int]): Int = {
    if (xs.isEmpty) then 0            
    else xs.head + sum(xs.tail)    
}
